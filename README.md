# Jitter-GLSL-Shaders
Custom GLSL Shaders for Max/MSP/Jitter

This repository contains GLSL shaders ported for Max/MSP/Jitter written in the with the JXS header (XML based).
They are intended for direct use with MAX/MSP/Jitter with the jit.gl.slab object.

Copy in a path visible to Max in order to let jit.gl.slab find the shaders JXS files.

Note: the same shaders are part of the V-Module Max for Live device set (available at http://www.fabriziopoce.com/download.html)
